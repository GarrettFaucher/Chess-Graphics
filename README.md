# Program Summary
This program runs a functional game of chess using graphics. 

The program opens to a general start screen. When the start button is clicked, the program moves onto a new screen featuring a chess board and a sidebar with several additional buttons. Once the program opens to this page the user(s) may play using the game already set up, or they may select one of the three challenges. 

In order to play the user(s) click and hold on a chess piece and any possible moves will be displayed. Only the pieces of the current team/color can be moved. To move a piece, the user clicks and drags the piece to one of the highlighted tiles. 
The chess piece will move to the selected tile and it will be the other player's turn. If one (or both) of the Kings are in check, a red shadow appears around the piece. At any point, a player may resign by pressing the 'C' key to concede, losing the game. When a game ends, a message will appear and no further moves can be made.

Along the right side of the chessboard is the sidebar with five buttons. On the top is a reset button which sets the game back to the standard chess setup. There are also three challenge boards, each featuring a chess game that has progressed to a point of difficulty. At the bottom of the sidebar is an end button which ends the game and the program moves on to an ending screen.
