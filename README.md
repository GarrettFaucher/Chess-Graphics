# Program Summary
This program runs a functional game of chess using graphics. At the beginning of the program a general start
screen appears. Once a user clicks on start, they are brought to a new screen featuring a standard game of chess
where users take turns moving the chess pieces. Players can click on a chess piece of the current color and
any possible moves are displayed. If the user drags the mouse to one of the highlighted tiles and releases
the mouse, the chess piece moves to the tile and the game moves on to the other player's turn. Once one
(or both) of the Kings are in check, a red box appears around the piece. At any point on the game a player
may resign by pressing the 'C' key to concede. When a game ends, a message appears stating the winner
and no further moves can be made.

Along the right side of the chessboard is four buttons. There is a reset button which resets the game back to the
standard chess setup. There are also three challenge boards. There is an end button which brings the game to an ending screen.
